# LearnThat

Learning a language is a long and grueling process that takes years of consistent practice and dedication. LearnThat is the perfect Google Chrome Extension to help you make that journey just a little bit easier. When reading your language of choice on your laptop but coming across a word you don’t know, simply double-tap to highlight it and pull up the definition. However, instead of being just a more accessible dictionary, LearnThat will also store the words you don’t know in memory and allow you to access all these words later for you to review!


# MVP

  - Double-click on a word (highlight it) to pull up its definition and save it to a vocabulary list
  - Click to hear word pronunciation
  - Keep track of how many times each word is double-tapped, and display a short quiz of the most double-tapped words often
  - Sort different vocabulary words into folders 
  - Display the “Word You Struggled the Most With” based on data from the past x days


# Stretch Goals

- Keep track of the context that you last saw the word in
- Feature to write your own definition of a word (for slang)
- Display stats of the most saved words, total words searched up
- Allow user to manually type in a word to save (for audio)
- Generate a random daily word in target language for them to practice
- Quiz game feature to practice words (like Quizlet Matching)
